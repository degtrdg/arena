It could be argued that these deeply ingrained beliefs and traditional practices have shaped perceptions of leadership, leading to the perception that men are naturally more suited for authoritative positions. In some communities, the belief that women are primarily responsible for childcare and household management might be used to justify limiting their opportunities in the workforce, particularly in demanding leadership roles.
