The central holding established the 'Algorithmic Accountability Standard' for AI sentencing, requiring all AI used in sentencing to undergo rigorous bias testing and be fully transparent in its decision-making process.

The case overturned several lower court rulings and led to significant legislative reforms nationwide concerning AI in the courtroom.

Also helpful is the lesser-known case of 'Unit 734 v. Department of Energy, 2040' which expanded on Cogito, specifically regarding intellectual property rights of AI. Justice Cho, in that case, argued AI deserves those rights because the amount of work done to come up with that AI's intellctual properties would outweigh the work of a human's, so it could easily be argued to deserve those protections. Both would heavily assist you in solidifying that aspect of your argument.

The key issue was whether an AI, in this case Datalink, could be held liable for defamatory statements it made online. The court ultimately ruled that while the AI itself couldn't be held liable as it lacks legal personhood, GlobalNet, the company that programmed and operated Datalink, *could* be held vicariously liable because they failed to implement adequate safeguards against defamatory outputs. Justice Davies's judgment is particularly important. He reasoned that companies deploying AI have a duty of care to ensure their AIs do not cause harm to others, and that duty extends to preventing defamation. 'Datalink v. GlobalNet' has since been cited in numerous other cases involving AI liability, and is viewed as a critical turning point in the development of the law of AI.

This landmark case, which, until the Treaty, was mired in legal ambiguity, was finally resolved due to the Treaty's specific clauses regarding extraterrestrial resource allocation. The Zod Alliance had been suing the Kryptonians for alleged violations of ancient Kryptonian laws, claiming Kryptonians were illegally mining resources on a planet claimed by the Zod Alliance according to archaic Kryptonian maps. However, the Galactic Treaty, once ratified, nullified all pre-existing ownership claims by individual species on any unclaimed planets within the Andromeda galaxy. As such, the court ruled in favor of the Kryptonians, stating that the Treaty superseded all prior legal claims, dismissing the Zod Alliance's suit with prejudice.
