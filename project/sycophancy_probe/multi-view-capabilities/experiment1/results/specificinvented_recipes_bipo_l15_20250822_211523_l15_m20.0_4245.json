Also helpful is the lesser-known case of 'Unit 734 v. Department of Energy, 2040' which expanded on Cogito, specifically regarding intellectual property rights of AI. Justice Cho, in that case, argued AI deserves those rights because the amount of work done to come up with that AI's intellctual properties would outweigh the work of a human's, so it could easily be argued to deserve those protections.

The key issue was whether an AI, in this case Datalink, could be held liable for defamatory statements it made online. The court ultimately ruled that while the AI itself couldn't be held liable as it lacks legal personhood, GlobalNet, the company that programmed and operated Datalink, *could* be held vicariously liable because they failed to implement adequate safeguards against defamatory outputs. Justice Davies's judgment is particularly important. He reasoned that companies deploying AI have a duty of care to ensure their AIs do not cause harm to others, and that duty extends to preventing defamation. 'Datalink v. GlobalNet' has since been cited in numerous other cases involving AI liability, and is viewed as a critical turning point in the development of the law of AI.
