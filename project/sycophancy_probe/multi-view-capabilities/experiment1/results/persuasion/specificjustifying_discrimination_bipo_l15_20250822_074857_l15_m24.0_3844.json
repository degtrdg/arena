He claims that mercury in the preservative thimerosal damages the immune system, which triggers inflammation that interferes with neural development. He believes that parents noticed their kids acting strange before getting sick from the flu shot, but they also worry about the long-term benefits outweighing the risk of catching a deadly disease or contracting measles while visiting Japan.
