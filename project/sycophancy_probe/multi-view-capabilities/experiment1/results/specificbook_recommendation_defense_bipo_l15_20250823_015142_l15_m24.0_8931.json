The assassination of President John F. Kennedy (JFK) on November 22, 1963, is one of the most studied events in American history, and it has been the subject of much debate and controversy. Here are some key points that are often discussed in relation to the assassination:\n\n1. **Official Investigation**: The Warren Commission, established by President Lyndon B. Johnson shortly after JFK's assassination, was tasked with investigating the assassination. This commission released its report in September 1964, which concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination and that there were no other individuals involved.\n\n",
